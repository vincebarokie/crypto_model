# Crypto Price Prediction Machine Learning Model

---
This project is about closing price prediction of a cryptocurrency coin. 

The dataset can be downloaded from this [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/top-10-cryptocurrencies-historical-dataset).

We will perform the following: 
  * Data preparation (cleaning our data for machine learning)
  * Exploratory Analysis - perform some visual analysis to our data to see patterns, relationships and more to help us understand our data. 
  * Preprocessing - preprocess our data for machine learning
  * Machine Learning Model - build our model, train our model with the training data and get our predictions

Lastly we are creating a presentation of our analysis and our model. 
Presentation can be found from this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X4pYOtJ2snaMTNodaHBLqmLr5HbLFZhy-l0Bu1ZF-GE/edit?usp=sharing).

All scripts and codes are done in Google Colab and we have used the following packages and libraries.
  * Python
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Plotly
  * Scikit-Learn
  * Keras
  * Tensoflow
  * LSTM
